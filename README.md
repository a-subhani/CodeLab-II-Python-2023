# CodeLab-II-Pyhton Exercises

## Module Overview

CodeLab II extends your knowledge of coding to include object-oriented programming (OOP). You build on the  programming techniques acquired in CodeLab I and move towards deploying OOP concepts that enhance the functionality and efficiency of your builds.

Through the course of the module you will be introduced to the use of libraries and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to begin developing programmes with Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs). Course content will be delivered through coding exercises and creative briefs that enable you to put newly learnt techniques into practice.

Beyond developing new technical skills, you learn about the software development cycle. Here you form an understanding of how software projects are planned, implemented and maintained in industry. The ultimate aim of CodeLab II is to develop your programming proficiency to the point where you can independently experiment with unfamiliar coding techniques and languages successfully.

### Chapter Exercises

Each workbook chapter includes exercises to put into practice the techniques you have learned. You should aim to complete these exercises in order as without a firm understanding of previously introduced techniques you may struggle to complete the latter more advanced exercises. Exercises with a tickmark included under the heading *Assessment Exercises*  represent exercises that must be submitted as part of the Programming Skills Portfolio assessment as a minimum expectation. The assessment exercises section also contains some bonus exercises which can be completed for higher marks.

You will also find further exercises, which are provided to help you practice and develop your programming skills. Completing these exercises is highly encouraged, although they have **no impact** on the programming skills portfolio mark.

To complete the exercises:

* First make sure you have cloned this repository to your local machine
* Create a **separate project** for each exercise in the corresponsing chapter's exercise folder
* When happy with your solution commit and push your changes back to Github
* Please note that when pushing changes back to Github only the code files will be uploaded, not the Visual Studio / Xcode project files. These have been intentionally ignored by a .gitignore file in the root of the repository to keep Github desktop interface and the GitHub repository clutter free. If you need to access a project on a different machine to the one where the project was originally generated, you may need to create a fresh project and copy in the code from the .cpp file, or create a project from existing code. Guides for doing this are provided in the guides folder.*
### Guides

Guides on cloning this repository to your machine via GitHub desktop are provided in the guides folder, alongside general information on creating a project in Visual Studio VScode.

### Resources

This folder contains files required for the file handling tasks as well as some useful code snippets.
