# Chapter 5 - Exercises
Exercises under the heading **Assessment Exercises** with a ☑️ must be attempted as a minimum expectation of the programming skills portfolio assessment. The assessment exercises also include some bonus exercises, solving these bonus exercises offers the potential to attain marks in the higher grade boundaries.

Further exercises are provided for you to practice and develop your programming skills. Completing these exercises is encouraged, although they have **no impact** on the programming skills portfolio mark.
For each exercise you should create a _**new project**_ with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository. Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push the code to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish, only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.

## Assessment Exercises
### Exercise 1: Woof Woof ☑️
 
Develop a GUI using Tkinter with a class that defines the characteristics of a dog. The program should instantiate two objects from this class and assign data to its members.
The program should then output the data from each object and the oldest dog should woof via a class method.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 2: Student Class ☑️
Develop a GUI using Tkinter to Create a class called Students.
- The class should have the following members.```Name (string), Mark1 (int), Mark2 (int), Mark3 (int) ``` 
- The class should have the following methods
```calcGrade()``` - should return an average from the three marks.```display()```- should output the student name and calculated grade average
- Create one object using a constructor that contains parameters to initialize all of the variables
- Ask user to input the variable values using input() and pass the values to the second object

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 3: Employee Class ☑️
Develop a GUI using Tkinter to Create an employee class with the following members:
 ```name, age, id, salary```
- Add the following methods:
```setData()``` - should allow employee data to be set via user input,```getData()```- should output employee data to the console
- Create a list of 5 employees. Ask the user to enter the details of 5 employees using the add_employee method and then display the output using the display_emloyee method as mentioned below
Expected output:
```			
Name	Position	Salary	ID
Alice	Manager		9500.0	1
Bob	Accountant	6000.0	2
Brain	Social Media	4000.0	3
Frank	Salesman	2500.0	4
Marker	Clerk		1500.0	5
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 4: Shapes ☑️
Develop a GUI using Tkinter to calculate the area of Shapes.
Create a parent class called Shape. This should have the following methods
```inputSides()``` – Ask the user to enter the sides of the shape. Now create subclasses for a circle, rectangle, and triangle. These should include an appropriate ``` area()``` method that will use the side values from the shape class.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Exercise 5: Playing around in class ☑️
Use this exercise to play around with creating and accessing class members and methods. Develop a GUI using Tkinter to Create a class called Animal
- Give the class at least the following members  ```Type, Name, Colour, Age, Weight, Noise```
- The class should have the following methods
```sayHello()``` - says its name via print,```makeNoise()``` -make an appropriate noise via print, ```animalDetails()``` -output all the details of the animal object
- Instantiate at least two objects from your animal class (e.g. Dog, Cow)
- Set values for each of the variables
- Invoke each of the class functions

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Exercise 6: Arithmetic Operation ☑️
Develop a GUI to perform Arithmetic Operations.
- Create a class ArithmeticOperations with the following
- a result variable to store the result after calculation
- a function Calculate() - To perform an arithmetic operation selected by the user.
- You can use Combobox to provide users with options to perform selected arithmetic operations and entry widgets for the values.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Bonus Assessment Exercises
### Exercise A:  Playing around in class - Extension
In the above Exercise -Playing around in class ask the user to enter the values of the Animal
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Further Exercise
