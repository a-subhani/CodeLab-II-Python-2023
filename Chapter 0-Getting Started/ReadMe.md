# Getting Started

## Installing an IDE

Class demonstrations are taught using Visual Studio Code. You are welcome to use either VScode or Visual Studio. 
You can find information on how to start a project in Visual Studio or VScode in the guides provided on Lecture Materials.

## Practicing outside of class

Programming is a difficult skill to master and you will struggle to get to grips with it by coding in the classroom sessions alone. 
You need to practice coding between classes to ensure you do not get left behind. 
This workbook should be used to practice both inside and outside of class, allocating yourself time in the week to complete exercises not completed during the class.
4 -5 hours (or more) of additional practice each week will make a world of difference to your code.

## Using GitHub

Throughout CodeLab we will be using GitHub to keep track of the code we create. 
You should save the solutions to the chapter exercises in your CodeLab GitHub repository. 
Your tutor will review the code you post on GitHub in order to provide feedback on your work to help you improve. 
Guides on using GitHub can be found on Minerva and if you have any questions let your tutor know.
