## Exercise 1: Format Name☑️
Write a function that takes a first and last name through user input, and returns a neatly formatted full name. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 2: Sum Function☑️
Write a program that calculates the sum of two values. The program should get the two values from user input and output the results to screen.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 3: Area Function☑️
Code a program to display a menu on the screen that asks if the user wants to
```
1: Calculate the area of a square
2: Calculate the area of a circle
3: Calculate the area of a triangle 
```
Each of the 3 functions should ask for the necessary information (e.g. lengths and/or angles and output the answer.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 4: Calculator Function☑️
The program should display the following calculator menu:
```
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Modulus
```
The program will prompt the user to choose the operation choice (from 1 to 5). Then it asks the user to input values for the calculation. The program outputs the results of the calculation. The program should end by asking if the user would like to perform another calculation or not.

&nbsp;
## Exercise 5: Product of list items☑️
Write a program that passes a list as an argument to a function. The function should then calculate the product (values multiplied) of the list values and return this value back to the main program.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 6: Exercise – Factorial☑️
Find factorial of n numbers using recursive function
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 7: Lamda function☑️
Create the list marks with the given values

```marks = [("CodeLab I",67),("web Development", 75),("CodeLabII",74),("Smartphone Apps",68),("Games Development",70),("Responsive web",65)]```
 
Using lambda function in the function sort the list elements of the tuple based on marks low to high and high to low
&nbsp;

## Optional Exercise 8: Count characters
Write program to count number of vowels and consonants in the given string
Output:
```
Enter a word: hello world
Total number of letters: 11
Number of vowels:  3
