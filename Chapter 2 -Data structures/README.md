- Access the value at index -3
- Reverse the tuple and print the original tuple and reversed tuple

## Exercise 5: Count items☑️ 
Write Python Program to Count the Number of Times an Item Appears in the List

```staff = ["Arshiya", "Usman", "Iftikhar", "Usman", "Anmol","Zainab","Iftikhar", "Arshiya","Jake","Iftikhar"]```

## Optional Exercise 6: Locations List
Using the list 

```locations =['dubai','paris', 'switzerland', 'London', 'amsterdam', 'New York']```

- Print the list and find the length of the list
