## Exercise 5: Count items☑️ 
Write Python Program to Count the Number of Times an Item Appears in the List

```staff = ["Arshiya", "Usman", "Iftikhar", "Usman", "Anmol","Zainab","Iftikhar", "Arshiya","Jake","Iftikhar"]```

- Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list
- Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
- Use reverse() to change the order of your list.
- Print the list to show that its order has changed.
- Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order.
