# Chapter 4 - Exercises
Exercises with a tick mark ☑️ represent exercises that must be submitted for the Programming Skills Portfolio as a minimum expectation. Completing more exercises provides the opportunity to attain higher marks. For each exercise you should create a new project with the name of the exercise and save it to this folder in your local repository.

Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push your solutions to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish, only those pushed before the deadline will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.

## Exercise 1: User information ☑️ 
Develop a GUI App to create a file called ```bio.txt``` and write the following information to the file asking user to enter the values:
Name
Age
Hometown
Each piece of data should be on a new line
Once the data has been written to the file, read the data from the file and output the data.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 2: Count ☑️ 
The file ```sentences.txt``` has a list of string data. Develop a GUI App that finds out how many times the following string appears 

Hello my name is Peter Parker
I love Python Programming
Love
Enemy

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Extension
Create an entry label for free search in the above app

## Exercise 3: Reading to a List ☑️ 
The file ```numbers.txt``` has a list of 100 integer numbers each on a newline. Create a python program that puts this data into a list, then output the values in integer format.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 4: letter count ☑️ 

Develop a GUI App that asks the user to enter a character, reads the contents of the ```sentences.txt``` file, and counts the occurrences of the letter.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 5: Password Check ☑️ 

Develop a GUI App to check the validity of a password given by the user in the entry widget. The password should satisfy the following criteria: 
- Contain at least 1 letter between a and z 
- Contain at least 1 number between 0 and 9 
- Contain at least 1 letter between A and Z
- Contain at least 1 character from $, #, @ 
- Minimum length of password: 6 
- Maximum length of password: 12

Ask user to include a maximum of 5 passcode attempts. Each time the user enters an incorrect passcode, they should be prompted of how many passcode attempts remain. If there are 5 failed passcode attempts the while loop should break and inform the user that the authorities have been alerted!

## Bonus Assessment Exercise:  Petrol Price
Every time a motorist buys some petrol, he notes the number of liters bought and the amount paid per liter. This data can be found in the ```petrolPrice.txt``` file in your GitHub repository.The data is stored in columns separated by a tabbed space, like the following sample:
```
Liters	cost
20.0	  56.40
9.6	  29.95
5.0	  15.60
15.0	  54.30
18.4	  65.32
18.7	  75.36
17.7	  80.00
```
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Develop a GUI App that calculates:

- What was the cost of petrol per liter bought?
- What was the overall average price per liter of petrol bought?
- How much petrol in liters was bought at under 3.5AED per liter?
&nbsp;

- to match a string that contains only upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
- to match a string will start with a specific number
- to find the substrings within a string
