## Exercise 1: User information ☑️ 
Write a program to create a file called ```bio.txt``` and write the following information to the file asking user to enter the values:
Name
Age

Each piece of data should be on a new line
Once the data has been written to the file, read the data from the file and output the data.

&nbsp;
## Exercise 2: Count ☑️ 
The file ```sentences.txt``` has a list of string data. Create a program that finds out how many times the following sentence appears “Hello my name is Amster Sani”

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 3: Reading to a List ☑️ 
The file ```numbers.txt``` has a list of 100 integer numbers each on a newline. Create a program that puts this data into a list, then output the values in integer format.

## Exercise 4: Petrol Price ☑️ 

Every time a motorist buys some petrol, he notes the number of liters bought and the amount paid per liter. This data can be found in the ```petrolPrice.txt``` file in your GitHub repository.The data is stored in columns separated by a tabbed space, like the following sample:
```
Liters	cost
20.0	  56.40
9.6	  29.95
5.0	  15.60
15.0	  54.30
18.4	  65.32
18.7	  75.36
17.7	  80.00
```
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Write a program that calculates:

- What was the overall average price per litre of petrol bought?
- How much petrol in litres was bought at under 3.5AED per liter?

## Exercise 5: letter count ☑️ 

Write a program that reads the contents of the ```sentences.txt``` file and counts the occurrences of each letter.

&nbsp;

## Exercise 6 : Password Check ☑️ 

Write a program to check the validity of a password given by user. The password should satisfy the following criteria: 
- Contain at least 1 letter between a and z 
- Contain at least 1 number between 0 and 9 
- Contain at least 1 letter between A and Z
- Contain at least 1 character from $, #, @ 
- Minimum length of password: 6 
- Maximum length of password: 12

Ask user to include a maximum of 5 passcode attempts. Each time the user enters an incorrect passcode, they should be prompted of how many passcode attempts remain. If there are 5 failed passcode attempts the while loop should break and inform the user that the authorities have been alerted!
