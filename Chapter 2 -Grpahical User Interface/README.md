- Create an int list with 10 values
- Output the list using a for loop

## Exercise 3 : Film Dictionary☑️ 
Create a dictionary that contains relevant data for films (e.g. Title, Director, etc). Display the film details using loop

## Exercise 4: Year Tuples☑️ 

Create a tuple with values

```year = (2017,2003,2011,2005,1987,2009,2020,2018,2009)```

- Access the value at index -3
- Reverse the tuple and print the original tuple and reversed tuple 
- Count number of times 2009 is in the tuple (use count() method) 
- Get the index value of 2018(Use index method) 
- Find length of given tuple(Use len() method)

## Exercise 5: Count items☑️ 
Write Python Program to Count the Number of Times an Item Appears in the List

```staff = ["Arshiya", "Usman", "Iftikhar", "Usman", "Anmol","Zainab","Iftikhar", "Arshiya","Jake","Iftikhar"]```

(Hint: For each item in the list consider it as a key, and the number of times these items appear will be its associated value)

## Optional Exercise 6: Locations List
Using the list 

```locations =['dubai','paris', 'switzerland', 'London', 'amsterdam', 'New York']```

- Print the list and find the length of the list
- Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.
- Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
- Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list
- Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
- Use reverse() to change the order of your list.
- Print the list to show that its order has changed.
- Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order.
- Print the list to show that its order has been changed.
- Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order.
- Print the list to show that its order has changed.
