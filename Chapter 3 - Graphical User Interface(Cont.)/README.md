## Exercise 1: Greeting App ☑️
Develop a GUI to greet the user. The app should have two frames: InputFrame and DisplayFrame.

In InputFrame, include the following:
-A title label in blue.

## Exercise 3: Area Function☑️
Develop a GUI application using tkinter that allows users to calculate and display the areas of various shapes, including circles, squares, and rectangles. The application should utilize a tabbed interface to organize the calculations for each shape.
Each of the 3 functions should ask for the necessary information (e.g. lengths and/or angles and output the answer.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 4: Calculator Function☑️
The program should display the following calculator menu:
```
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Modulus
```
The program will prompt the user to choose the operation choice (from 1 to 5). Then it asks the user to input values for the calculation. The program outputs the results of the calculation. The program should end by asking if the user would like to perform another calculation or not.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 5: Product of list items☑️
Write a program that passes a list as an argument to a function. The function should then calculate the product (values multiplied) of the list values and return this value back to the main program.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 6: Exercise – Factorial☑️
Find factorial of n numbers using recursive function
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 7: Lamda function☑️
Create the list marks with the given values

```marks = [("CodeLab I",67),("web Development", 75),("CodeLabII",74),("Smartphone Apps",68),("Games Development",70),("Responsive web",65)]```
 
Using lambda function in the function sort the list elements of the tuple based on marks low to high and high to low

## Optional Exercise 8: Count characters
Write program to count number of vowels and consonants in the given string
Output:

Enter a word: hello world
Total number of letters: 11
Number of vowels:  3
Number of consonants:  7
Number of special characters:  1
```

## Optional Exercise 9: Power recursive function
Write a program to find power of number using recursive function
Output: 
Enter the number: 2
Enter the power value: 3
The value of 2 to the power of 3 is 8
