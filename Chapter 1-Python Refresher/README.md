# Chapter 1 - Exercises

Exercises under the heading **Assessment Exercises** with a ☑️ must be attempted as a minimum expectation of the programming skills portfolio assessment. The assessment exercises also include some bonus exercises, solving these bonus exercises offers the potential to attain marks in the higher grade boundaries.

Further exercises are provided for you to practice and develop your programming skills. Completing these exercises is encouraged, although they have **no impact** on the programming skills portfolio mark.
For each exercise you should create a _**new project**_ with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository. Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push the code to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish, only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.

## Assessment Exercises

### Exercise 1: User Input Output ☑️ 
Write code to prompt the user to input her/his name and age and print these details on the screen. Find the length of the name and also the age of the user after one year.
The format of text should look like the sample output below.
(Use title() function)
```
Hello, user!
What is your name?
alpha s
What is your age?
22
It is good to meet you, Alpha S
The length of your name is:
5
You will be 23 in a year.
```
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Exercise 2: Maths ☑️ 
Write a program that evaluates the following calculations for two int numbers obtained from the user and outputs the results to the console:

```Sum (+) | Diff (-) | Product (x) | Quotient (/) | Remainder (%)```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 3: Is it Triangle ☑️ 
Write a program that asks the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
Use the triangle inequality to determine if we have a triangle: In mathematics, the triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side ([see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality))
#### Extension Problem (Optional):
If valid, ask the user for the length of the sides and have the program correctly classify the type of triangle as either: Equilateral, Isosceles or Scalene  ([see here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/triangle.html))
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Exercise 4: Largest Number ☑️ 
Write a program to input three numbers and outputs the largest using the multiple if -else statements

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 5: Continue ☑️ 
Write a program that implements a while loop. This program should ask the user if they would like to continue and use the while loop to keep looping as long as they enter the letter Y. Once the while loop has terminated output the number of times it is executed.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 6: FizzBuzz ☑️ 
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 7: Even Numbers ☑️ 
Write a program that prints the even numbers from 1 to 100. 
Hint - Use Continue Statement

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 8: Print Pattern ☑️ 
Write a program to display the following pattern using nested loops.
```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Exercise 9: Integer List☑️ 

Create an integer list and perform following operations
- Create an int list with 10 values
- Output the list using a for loop
- Output the highest and lowest value
- Sort the elements in ascending order
- Sort the elements in descending order
- Append two elements 
- Print the list after appending


&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 10 : Film Dictionary☑️ 
Create a dictionary that contains relevant data for films (e.g. Title, Director, etc). Display the film details using loop

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 11: Year Tuples☑️ 

Create a tuple with values

```year = (2017,2003,2011,2005,1987,2009,2020,2018,2009)```

- Access the value at index -3
- Reverse the tuple and print the original tuple and reversed tuple 
- Count number of times 2009 is in the tuple (use count() method) 
- Get the index value of 2018(Use index method) 
- Find length of given tuple(Use len() method)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise 12: Area Function☑️
Code a program to display a menu on the screen that asks if the user wants to
```
1: Calculate the area of a square
2: Calculate the area of a circle
3: Calculate the area of a triangle 
```
Each of the 3 functions should ask for the necessary information (e.g. lengths and/or angles and output the answer.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Exercise 13: Product of list items☑️
Write a program that passes a list as an argument to a function. The function should then calculate the product (values multiplied) of the list values and return this value back to the main program.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

# Bonus Assessment Exercises
### Exercise A: Multiplication Tables ☑️ 

Write a program to print Multiplication table in following format from 1 to 10 tables
Hint: Use nested loops
```
Multiplication table of : 1
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
1 x 4 = 4
1 x 5 = 5
1 x 6 = 6
1 x 7 = 7
1 x 8 = 8
1 x 9 = 9
1 x 10 = 10

### Exercise B: Locations List ☑️ 
Using the list 

```locations =['dubai','paris', 'switzerland', 'London', 'amsterdam', 'New York']```

- Print the list and find the length of the list
- Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.
- Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
- Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list
- Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
- Use reverse() to change the order of your list.
- Print the list to show that its order has changed.
- Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order.
- Print the list to show that its order has been changed.
- Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order.
- Print the list to show that its order has changed.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Exercise C: Calculator Function☑️
The program should display the following calculator menu:
```
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Modulus
```
The program will prompt the user to choose the operation choice (from 1 to 5). Then it asks the user to input values for the calculation. The program outputs the results of the calculation. The program should end by asking if the user would like to perform another calculation or not.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
